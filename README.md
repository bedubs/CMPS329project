This program works by first running the server with 'python server.py' or './server.py' within the directory the file is in.

From this point, you can connect via telnet or run the client for an automated example of the requests and responses.

For telnet, use: telnet localhost 8008
Run the client:  python client.py or ./client.py

Telnet commands that are recognized are:
'HELO' and 'any name' as an argument
'REQTIME'
'REQDATE'
'ECHO' and 'any string' as an argument
'REQIP'
'BYE'

Both the client and server were tested on Ubuntu 14.04 using Python versions 2.7.6 and 3.4.3, as well as telnet in the terminal.

Both Neil and William have submitted the assignment individually, although it is the same project that was completed together.

Also, we probably got carried away and made it more complicated and a bit sloppy, but it does work...it works well...and we had fun learning what we could do with Python.
